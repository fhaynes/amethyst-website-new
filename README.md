## Building Locally

To generate a local copy of the website, do:

```
$ ./generate.sh
```

However, this is a long process as it also generates documentation.
If you only care about the website itself for testing purposes, do:

```
$ ./quick_build.sh
```

Please note that this last methods requires you to have [Gutenberg][gb] installed.

The homepage can be found at `build/index.html`.
