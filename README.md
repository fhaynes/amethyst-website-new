## Building Locally

To generate a complete local copy of the website with documentation, run:
```
$ ./generate.sh
```

Note that this is a long process.  If you are looking to get up and running quickly for development, first install [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/) and then run the following:


```
$ cd src && zola serve
```

This will generate temporary files in `src/public` as well as start a local server with live updates.  When the server is stopped, all generated files will be cleaned up and deleted.

Alternatively, you can run `./quick_build`.  This is similar to ```cd src && zola build```.  Note that this folder is in the project root under `build`, and will not automatically delete itself.  The homepage can be found at `public/index.html`.
