        <a href="/book/latest">The book</a> will guide you through your first steps in Amethyst. It will teach you the basics: how the architecture of Amethyst
        works, how to create a new project, and demonstrate some of the most important features of the engine.
    </p>

    <p>
        Then, or alternatively, you can check out
        <a href="{{ config.extra.github_url_base }}/tree/{{ latest_release_tag }}/examples">the Amethyst examples</a>
        to get a deeper understanding of what an Amethyst project looks like. This will also get you
        accustomed to the Entity Component System architecture if this concept is new to you.
