                <h2>High Performance</h2>
                <p>
                    Amethyst uses a rigorous <strong><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93component%E2%80%93system">Entity Component System (ECS)</a></strong> architecture to organize game logic. This abstracts away some of the parallelism work, allowing easier exploitation of multi-threading in games. The ECS is rich in features and very efficient, as it never does any memory locking while remaining entirely thread-safe.

                <p>
                    Amethyst uses gfx-rs to render graphics with OpenGL, and soon Vulkan and Metal. It is meant to be used for 2D and 3D, with various utilities for both types of games. It should be beginner friendly but also allow more advanced uses such as custom render passes and GLSL shaders.

                    Thanks to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust programming language</a>, Amethyst uses all CPU cores to run its internals and logic. A lot of optimizations have yet to be done, but the current status is already showing great potential.
