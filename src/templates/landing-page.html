                    Amethyst is a data-driven game engine built for high parallel performance and easy prototyping. It is
                    <b>still under heavy development and should be used with care</b>, and therefore this webpage is more about
                    what it will be than what it currently is. We are still lacking important features that will come from
                    our active development team.

                <br>Amethyst uses gfx-rs to render graphics with OpenGL, and soon Vulkan and Metal. It is meant to be used for
                2D and 3D, with various utilities for both types of games. It should be beginner friendly but also allow
                more advanced uses such as custom render passes and GLSL shaders.

                    Amethyst uses a rigorous
                    <b>Entity Component System (ECS)</b> architecture to organize game logic. This abstracts away some of the
                    parallelism work, allowing easier exploitation of multi-threading in games. The ECS is rich in features
                    and very efficient, as it never does any memory locking while remaining entirely thread-safe.

                    have yet to be done, but the current status is already showing great potential.

                    <br>The ECS implemented in Amethyst is one of the fastest publicly available game engine ECS in the world.
