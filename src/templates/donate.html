                <h2>Thank You!</h2>
                <p>
                    First of all, thank you! Amethyst is made up of all volunteers; your support
                    means a lot to us. All donations go to forwarding the mission of the Amethyst
                    Foundation; creating a game engine that is fast, reliable, open-source, and
                    free. Here are some ways we use donations:

                    <ul>
                        <li>Infrastructure and hosting costs</li>
                        <li>Purchasing merchandise for events</li>
                        <li>Travel costs to relevant events</li>
                        <li>Creation of assets (art, code, design, etc) by an outside contractor if needed</li>
                        <li>Hiring part-time or full-time developers to work on the engine</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </div>

            <h2>Important Tax Info</h2>
            <p>
                Amethyst is a pending 501(c)(3) non-profit. This means we have filed all needed
                paperwork with the IRS, and are awaiting final approval. This process can take
                between 3 to 6 months. Until a final determination is made, the IRS allows us to act
                as a full 501(c)(3). We do not anticipate any issues. More information can be found
                on the IRS site. The important thing for you to know is that if the final
                determination does not grant us 501(c)(3) status, your donation may not be
                tax-deductible.
