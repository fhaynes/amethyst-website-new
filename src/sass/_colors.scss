# Amethyst Colors

These colors exist to keep a consistent and nice looking color pattern throughout Amethyst's
different products. If you need to use colors, you can probably find what you need in here. Don't
diverge if not absolutely necessary, such as with images.

## Neutral colors
If you are going to be designing something monochrome, use the colors from the "Neutral" section.
To your disposal, you have one dark color and two shades of light colors. The alternative light
color can be used to break a page up in sections without feeling the same throughout.

## Main branding colors
If you want to make something that highlights the Amethyst brand, you can use the colors from the
"Main branding" section. These are most commonly used for links but also have other purposes.

## Complementary brand colors
Because designs usually feel stale if you only utilize one shade of color, we have complementary
brand colors too at our disposal. These can be used when you just need that extra bit of flare.

## Contrast
The colors marked as "Light link" and "Dark link" have been checked to be AAA compliant on their
respective background. DO NOT use any other color for important information.
